# Motivation

Syncing backend and front-end projects is often a difficult work. From writing manually api calls for different front-facing part of an application,
such as JavaScript, C++, Swift, and almost any other language.

In years I have seen different tools, from OpenAPI generators and GRPC to solve this issue, but yet none of them is providing the
actual solution.

Emi compiler generates tools to create backend, and uses standard elements in target languages to just document details more.
