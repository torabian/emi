# Getting started

Emi is written in Golang, and should be available as standalone binaries, mac brew, also on `npx` for npm community.
There is playground as well, which allows you to write and download the files all in a browser, which might become handy.

There is a `wasm` file, which can be used on javascript environments, in case you need to install it in your javascript project.


## Via Npm (npx)

The compiler for all targets is also available as npm package, just type:

```bash
npx emicc
```

and it would show the compiler options, you should be able to compile all the targets via npm as well.
(means it's not limited only to javascript/typescript)
