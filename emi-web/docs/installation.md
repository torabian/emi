# Getting started

Emi is written in Golang, and should be available as standalone binaries, mac brew, also on `npx` for npm community.
There is playground as well, which allows you to write and download the files all in a browser, which might become handy.

There is a `wasm` file, which can be used on javascript environments, in case you need to install it in your javascript project.
