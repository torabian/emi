# Javascript(Type?) Compiler

Javascript, and typescript, are the most wide used langauges in every platform and use case these days. Most of the code written in different
backend languages, in the end, almost always is going to be used somehow by a javascript envrionment.
Therefor Emi compiler, provides a built-in javascript/typescript compiler for the definitions. The generated content aimed to be used in many applications,
which is basically Vanilla javascript/typescript, React, Nest.js, and since it's being compiled to bare minimum javascript, in any other
framework which might be needed.

**Every action in Emi js compiler will be convereted to typescript with very high coverage with --tags typescript flag**, and the typescript support
is one of the highest quality within the competing tools.

JS Compiler, is mainly generating type-safe objects out of the Emi definition, and targets to make the content super portable. Due to highly usage of
`nest.js` and `react`, there is an added flags called for each of them to modify or append extra features.

* `--tags react` would generate the react hooks for each action, using tanstack react-query for http, an internal useSse and useWebSocketX hooks for SSE and websockets.
* `--tags nestjs` would generate decorators which would make the req, headers, qs, portable directly into nest.js without extra code written by the developer.

For typescript support, just append `typescript` to the tags, for example `--tags react,nestjs,typescript` would generate them all, in typescript.
