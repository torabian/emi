# Emi definitions

In this document, we discuss the emi definition, and features it has. Emi definition can be defiend via yaml, or json,
and doesn't have a special language. It can have a different series of features in it, from actions, dtos, entities.
In an absract level, these are just definitions, which different sub compilers, for example js, would create
different target codes (React, Vanilajs, Nest.js) based on the tags provided.

Emi definitions aim to prevent having specific target language code, so it could be compiled into as many as languages over time.
You will find all structs in https://github.com/torabian/emi/tree/main/lib/core/Emi.go 
        
## Simple emi module
Here, you can see a minimal module written in Emi, which defines get method to fetch a json placeholder.
```yaml
name: sampleModule
actions:
  - name: getSinglePost
    url: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/:id
    cliName: get-single-post
    method: get
    description: Get's an specific post from the endpoint
    out:
      fields:
        - name: userId
          type: int64
        - name: id
          type: int64
        - name: title
          type: string
        - name: body
          type: string
```
## Emi main features.
On the yaml root, you can set different features of a the module, such as entities, dtos, actions, and many more.
| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `namespace` | `string` | Represents where is the location of the module in app tree. Similar to PHP namespacing sytem it be used to explicitly as export path of the actions for client frameworks |
| `description` | `string` | Description of module and it's purpose. Used in code gen and creating documents. |
| `version` | `string` | Version of the module. Helpful for different code generation phases but it's not necessary. |
| `name` | `string` | Name of the module. Needs to be lower camel case and Module.go and Module.dyno.go will be generated based on this name. |
| `enums` | `array` | Module level enums which can be used across the other parts of generated code. |
| `dtos` | `array` | Dtos are basically golang structs with some additional functionality which can be used for request/response actions |
| `complexes` | `array` | Complex custom data types definitions and location |
| `actions` | `array` | Actions are similar to controllers in other frameworks. They are custom functionality available via CLI or Http requests and developer need to implement their logic |
| `remotes` | `array` | Remotes are definition of external services which could be contacted via http and Emi developer can make them typesafe by defining them here. |
