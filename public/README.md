# Emi Public Third Party examples API

In this folder, I place the actual thirdparty API's which are common and written by me as products,
to be used with some external products. The definitions are accurate, the generated code quality
is based on the level of the compiler, at the time.

## Allegro API

Allegro is a Polish online market, and very famous actually. They provide the API documentation,
and I manually typed all features in here. There is no relation between me and company at the writing of
this document; hence the accuracy and being up-to-date of the APIs really do not depend on me.
But you can use it, if you see it's fit. You can also copy the entire folder, and manually modify the definitions,
and regenerated them if needed.
