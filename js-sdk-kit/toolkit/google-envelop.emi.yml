  Generating envelop API responses using Emi itself. 
  Emi codegen is so strong that can generate deep classes in javascript which could be used
  in itself and in this example we are doing it.

  All responses can be wrapped in google json styleguide, which gives extream consistency.

dtos:
  - name: response
    fields:
      - name: apiVersion
        type: string
      - name: context
        type: string
      - name: data
        type: any
