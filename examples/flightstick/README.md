# FlightStick

This is a workshop, using Emi, which generates Unreal engine, Golang, and Kotlin.

It includes:

- A Kotlin app, which would read gyroscope, and send the pitch and bank information
- A golang server, which would read content from FlightStick app, and transfer it to Unreal
- An unreal plane example, which would fly :)
