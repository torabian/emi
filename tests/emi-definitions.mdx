# Emi definitions

In this document, we discuss the emi definition, and features it has. Emi definition can be defiend via yaml, or json,
and doesn't have a special language. It can have a different series of features in it, from actions, dtos, entities.
In an absract level, these are just definitions, which different sub compilers, for example js, would create
different target codes (React, Vanilajs, Nest.js) based on the tags provided.

Emi definitions aim to prevent having specific target language code, so it could be compiled into as many as languages over time.
You will find all structs in `lib/core/definitions.go`
